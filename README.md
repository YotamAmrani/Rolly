# Rolly
Aiming to create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, we have created ‘Rolly’. ‘Rolly’ recognizes predefined gestures, and translates them into commands. The device consists of a comfy cover from the outside, an accelerometer, and an Arduino board from the inside. Course: Human computer Interaction Guiding: Amit Zoran Project partner: Alon Emanuel
